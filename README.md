## Introduction

This repository contains the majority of projects that were developed for private 
requests throughout 2020-2025. The published projects contain source code with 
restrictions intended solely for visual review of my professional experience.

## Projects

During this period, various project works were completed: full web site development 
with deployment on VPS / private servers, Telegram bots, diverse parsers with 
additional technologies such as anti-detect browsers, multi-threaded applications 
both with GUI and CLI.
